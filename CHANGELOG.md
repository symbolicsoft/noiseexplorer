	- _Generated new implementations._
	- _Updated Travis-CI config. All implementations are passing tests in the pipeline.._
	- _Implementation versions now depend on src/versions.json._
	- _Updated pipeline script and added commit formatting._
	- _Generated new implementations._
	- _Fixed README.md for WASM implementations._

## Noise Explorer 0.3
	- Now based on Noise Protocol Framework revision 34.
	- Generate Go implementations and test-injected implementations.
	- Added detailed analysis feature for individual message patterns within Noise Handshake Patterns.
	- Added deferred handshake patterns from revision 34 to the compendium with formal verification results.
	- Added one-way handshake patterns to the compendium with formal verification results.
	- All formal verification results in the compendium, except for one-way handshake patterns, now include two tokenless message patterns.
	- The compendium now includes a search function that allows searching for Noise Handshake Pattern results by pattern name.
	- Added two parsing checks for Noise Handshake Patterns, suggested by Katriel Cohn-Gordon: `dhWithUnknownKey` and `unusedKeySent`.
	- ProVerif models for PSK-using Noise Handshake Patterns now are generated with the same queries and events as non-PSK Noise Handshake Patterns.
	- ProVerif models now generate fresh ephemerals for each session.
	- ProVerif models now have stronger separation between the sessions executed within an unbounded session model.
	- ProVerif models now model for an unbounded number of "tokenless" messages within each session in an unbounded number of sessions.
	- Redundancy elimination during the derivation phase is now enabled in ProVerif, which should speed up verification performance in some cases.
	- Bug fix: the PSK parsing check was not sufficiently precise due to a programming error.
	- Bug fix: command-line interface always required that attacker be specified when parsing patterns, even though the value is optional with a default value of `active`.
	- Add Noise Handshake Pattern validation rule 7.3.4 from revision 34.
	- ProVerif models may now be generated and downloaded directly from each Noise Handshake Pattern's compendium page.
	- Numerous other additions, improvements and bug fixes.

## Noise Explorer 0.2
	- Initial public release.
