# noiseexplorer_xx1_wasm (v1.0.4)
This implementation is generated by [Noise Explorer](https://noiseexplorer.com) and can be compiled to a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) binary by following the instructions below.

# Dev Dependencies:
To compile this implementation to WebAssembly, we recommend that you install the latest version of both
**Rust** and **Wasm-pack**.

You can install both packages by conveniently running
`make dependencies`.

# Compilation Instructions:

Running one of the commands from the table below compiles the implementation to a WASM module with helper files that are relevant to the platform of your choice.

| Command    | Usage | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make bundler` | [Bundler][bundlers] | Outputs JS code in a helper file that is suitable for interoperation with a Bundler like Webpack. You would have to `import` both the .js file and the `module`. The `main` key is specified in `pkg/package.json`. `sideEffects` is set to `false` by default. |
| `make nodejs` | [Node.js][deploy-nodejs] | Outputs JS code in a helper file that uses CommonJS modules. Convenient for use with a `require` statement. The `main` key is specified in `pkg/package.json`. |
| `make web` | [Native in browser][deploy-web] | Outputs JS code in a helper file that can be natively imported as an ES module in a browser. Note that the WebAssembly runtime must be manually instantiated and loaded. |
| `make no-modules` | [Native in browser][deploy-web] | Same as `make web`, except the JS code modifies the global state and must included inside a `script` tag in the HTML file.|

# Testing Instructions:

Implementations downloaded from our [compendium](https://noiseexplorer.com/patterns/) are pre-packaged with an **Integration Test**.

Depending on the option you chose to compile the code with from the section above, you could use one of the commands in the table below to run the **Integration Test** for your implementation.

| Command    | Usage | Description                                                                                                     |
