			<h2>Message Pattern Analysis</h2>
			<p>Message <span class="mono">B</span> is the second message in the <span class="mono">IX</span> Noise Handshake Pattern. It is sent from the responder to the initiator. In this detailed analysis, we attempt to give you some insight into the protocol logic underlying this message. The insight given here does not fully extend down to fully illustrate the exact state transformations conducted by the formal model, but it does describe them at least informally in order to help illustrate how Message <span class="mono">B</span> affects the protocol.</p>
<h3>Sending Message <span class="mono">B</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">B</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun writeMessage_b(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, payload:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = (empty, empty, empty) in
	let e = generate_keypair(key_e(me, them, sid)) in
	let ne = key2bit(getpublickey(e)) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, ne) in
	(* No PSK, so skipping mixKey *)
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, re)) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, rs)) in
	let s = generate_keypair(key_s(me)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext1:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, key2bit(getpublickey(s))) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(s, re)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext2:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, payload) in
	let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
	let message_buffer = concat3(ne, ciphertext1, ciphertext2) in
	let (ssi:symmetricstate, cs1:cipherstate, cs2:cipherstate) = split(ss) in
	(hs, message_buffer, cs1, cs2).
</p>
<h4>How each token is processed by the responder:</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">e</span>: Signals that the responder is sending a fresh ephemeral key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the new key into the session hash.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">ee</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a Diffie-Hellman shared secret derived from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's ephemeral key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixKey</span>, which calls the HKDF function using, as input, the existing <span class="mono">SymmetricState</span> key, and <span class="mono">dh(e, re)</span>, the Diffie-Hellman share calculated from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's ephemeral key.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">se</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a Diffie-Hellman shared secret derived from the initiator's static key and the responder's ephemeral key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixKey</span>, which calls the HKDF function using, as input, the existing <span class="mono">SymmetricState</span> key, and <span class="mono">dh(s, re)</span>, the Diffie-Hellman share calculated from the initiator's static key and the responder's ephemeral key.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">s</span>: Signals that the responder is sending a static key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span> is called on the static public key. If any prior Diffie-Hellman shared secret was established between the sender and the recipient, this allows the responder to communicate their long-term identity with some degree of confidentiality.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">es</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a Diffie-Hellman shared secret derived from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's static key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixKey</span>, which calls the HKDF function using, as input, the existing <span class="mono">SymmetricState</span> key, and <span class="mono">dh(e, rs)</span>, the Diffie-Hellman share calculated from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's static key.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>Message <span class="code">B</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated encryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">encryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Message <span class="mono">B</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">B</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun readMessage_b(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, message:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = deconcat3(message) in
	let valid1 = true in
	let re = bit2key(ne) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, key2bit(re)) in
	(* No PSK, so skipping mixKey *)
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, re)) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(s, re)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext1:bitstring, valid1:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext1) in
	let rs = bit2key(plaintext1) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, rs)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext2:bitstring, valid2:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext2) in
	if ((valid1 && valid2) && (rs = getpublickey(generate_keypair(key_s(them))))) then (
		let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
		let (ssi:symmetricstate, cs1:cipherstate, cs2:cipherstate) = split(ss) in
		(hs, plaintext2, true, cs1, cs2)

<h3>Queries and Results</h3>
Message <span class="mono">B</span> is tested against four authentication queries and five confidentiality queries.

<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>someone</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began, or Alice had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Authentication Grade 2: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_b(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,c_1220,stagepack_b(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob)) is true.</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender authentication</em> and is <em>Key Compromise Impersonation</em> resistance. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>someone</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>

<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender and receiver authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>Alice specifically</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began, or Alice had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Authentication Grade 4: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_b(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,alice,stagepack_b(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob)) is true.</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender and receiver authentication</em> and is <em>Key Compromise Impersonation</em> resistance. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>Alice specifically</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 1: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT attacker_p1(msg_b(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || event(LeakS(phase1,alice)) is true.</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>message secrecy</em> by checking if a passive attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key either before or after the protocol session.</p>

<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT attacker_p1(msg_b(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || (event(LeakS(phase1,alice)) && event(LeakS(p,bob))) is true.</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>forward secrecy</em> by checking if a passive attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key before the protocol session, or after the protocol session along with Bob's static public key (at any time.)</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 4: <span class="failed">Failed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT attacker_p1(msg_b(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || (event(LeakS(phase1,alice)) && event(LeakS(p,bob))) cannot be proved.</p>
